# The elevator problem

Inspired by https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~baveja/RLMasses/RL.html

To paraphrase the problem: you are tasked to write a program that decides if an
elevator should go up or down, whilst minimising some sort of reward function.

## TODO

- [x] model an elevator
- [x] model passengers calling the elevator
- [x] model passengers setting a destination
- [x] simulate a few steps for one elevator
- [x] model passengers exiting
- [x] measure passenger travel time in steps
- [x] define and print a score
- [x] run a simulation
- [x] generate travel request for residential flats simulation
- [ ] write random strategy and evaluate for different scenarios
- [ ] generate travel request for office simulation
- [ ] write different strategies * x
- [ ] pick a winning strategy
